These scripts accompany the Ten-bar Truss problem defined in C.2.2.  There is a matlab, python, and julia version.  Each takes has a function called `truss` that takes in an array of ten cross sectional areas, and returns the overall mass, and an array of ten stresses corresponding to stress in each element.
